                I have completed a 2018 Fast Trackers Training Programme working on the HS2.
                We had different exercises such as town planning, Also, we were working in
                 cross-college teams on an engineering project at UCL,designing a new high-speed 
                 rail route between London and Birmingham, mentored by engineers from network rail 
                 and Mott MacDonald. Our designs were justified and presented to a panel of judges, 
                 and peers. Finally, we presented designs to notable judges from across the sector.
